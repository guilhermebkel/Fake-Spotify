# Fake-Spotify
A spotify version made by me using their own API in order to fetch data.

### Environmental
The following configurations must be in the root `.env`
```sh
NODE_ENV=development
CLIENT_ID=
CLIENT_SECRET=
PORT=3000
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000/
SERVER_URL=http://localhost:5000/
SERVER_PORT=5000
```

These ones in the `src/config/env.js`
```sh
ONLINE_SERVER =
LOCAL_SERVER = 'http://localhost:5000/'
```
